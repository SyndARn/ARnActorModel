  "body": "#### ARnActorModel\r\nA C# Actor Model library.\r\n\r\nI was looking for an actor model things with some requirements :\r\n - no dependancy from another library\r\n - coding in plain C#, with such things like 'SendMessage', 'new Actor()', 'Become(behavior)'\r\n - actor can change behaviors\r\n - actor can send message\r\n - actor can create other actors\r\n - behaviors are dynamic\r\n - actor can send message across servers\r\n \r\n#### With ARnActor, now you can :\r\n\r\n    var sender = new BaseActor() ;\r\n    var receiver = new BaseActor() ;\r\n \r\n and in sender code ..\r\n \r\n    receiver.SendMessage(\"something\") ;\r\n \r\n#### The library holds some useful features :\r\n-  behavior can be attached or removed from actor, (an actor can change it's own behavior ...)\r\n-  actor can send messages across servers, you just need to hold a reference to another actor on a server ...\r\n-  some actor can behave as public services, or be supervised\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/1050h54h8pdfbbh0/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/SyndARn/arnactormodel/branch/master)\r\n\r\n\r\nUnit tests are included as well as some sample applications.\r\nI used the excellent [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover) to give some tests coverage.\r\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/SyndARn/ARnActorModel/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/SyndARn/ARnActorModel?branch=master)\r\n\r\nFor a common usage, you can download ARnActorModel here in Nuget. [![Nuget](https://buildstats.info/nuget/ARnActorModel)](http://nuget.org/packages/ARnActorModel) \r\n\r\n#### Current works\r\n\r\n- more coverage\r\n- moving to PCL/Universal/Shared model\r\n \r\n\r\n",
